// Initializing the Socket.IO connection with the server
const socket = io('http://localhost:4550', { transports: ["websocket"] });
//the io is provided from cdn only ..

// The 'io()' function automatically connects to the server from which the page was served.
// If you need to connect to a specific server, you can pass the URL like this:
// const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');  // Example for local server

// Now, 'socket' can be used to send and receive real-time events/messages.

/*
ðŸš€ Explanation of `{ transports: ["websocket"] }`:
- By default, Socket.IO first tries HTTP Polling and then upgrades to WebSockets.
- This option forces the connection to **use only WebSockets** and disables polling.
- Useful in environments where polling is unnecessary or blocked.
